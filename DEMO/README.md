The DEMO directory contains the Demonstration files (scripts .ima and data files, .uvt and .tab)

The data files (.uvt and .tab) should be copied to the gag_demo: directory for the demonstration
to work. The current release is missing some data files, because they are too big for GitHUB.

These data files are normally provided by the GILDAS installation however.
