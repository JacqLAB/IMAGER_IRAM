\subsection{APPLY}
\index{APPLY}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]APPLY [AMPLI|PHASE [gain]] [/FLAG]

      Apply  gain solution computed by MODEL and SOLVE (which are called im-
    plicitely by SELFCAL)  or obtained by READ CGAINS to the current UV  da-
    ta.  The optional arguments indicate whether this should be an AMPLITUDE
    or PHASE gain, and what gain value is used (in range 0 to 1).
      If no argument is given, the current SELF_MODE (see HELP  SELFCAL)  is
    used, and the gain is 1.0.


    The /FLAG option controls whether data without a valid gain solution are
    kept unchanged or flagged.

\subsubsection{APPLY /FLAG}

\begin{verbatim}

        [CALIBRATE\]APPLY [AMPLI|PHASE [gain]] /FLAG

      Apply gain solution (in AMPLITUDE or PHASE) and flag  data  without  a
    corresponding valid gain solution.

\subsection{SCALE\_FLUX}
\index{SCALE\_FLUX}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]SCALE_FLUX Find|Apply|List|Calibrate [Args...]

    A  set  of commands to check flux calibration on a day to day basis.  It
    gives the ratio between the observed flux (in the current UV  data  set)
    and  the model flux for each separate period.  The Model flux can be de-
    rived from Clean Component Tables using the MODEL command, or read  from
    an outer file using READ MODEL.

    Error bars are approximate. The User-defined command SOLVE_FLUX performs
    a more accurate evaluation of the error, but is typically 50 times slow-
    er.

    SCALE_FLUX FIND [DateTolerance [UVmin UVmax]]
    determines,  by linear regression, the best scaling factor to match date
    by date the UV data set with the MODEL data set.  Separate  Periods  are
    defined  when Dates differ more than DateTolerance (default 1 day). Only
    data with baseline lengths in the range UVmin UVmax are  considered  for
    the regression (default all).

    SCALE_FLUX APPLY VarName
    apply  previously  determined  flux scale factors to the MODEL data set,
    previously read by READ MODEL. This is in general used only in an itera-
    tive  search  way,  e.g.  by  the user-defined command SOLVE_FLUX (which
    calls procedure solve_flux). The resulting UV data set  is  loaded  into
    the specified VarName SIC variable.

    SCALE_FLUX LIST
    print out dates, baselines and determined flux factors

    SCALE_FLUX CALIBRATE
    apply  previously  determined  flux scale factors to the current UV data
    set (i.e. divide the visibilities by the scaling factor  of  each  date,
    and  correct  the  weight  accordingly).  This may then be written using
    command WRITE UV .

    SCALE_FLUX SOLVE [DateTolerance [UVmin UVmax]]
    combines FIND and PRINT behaviours.

\subsection{MODEL}
\index{MODEL}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]MODEL [MaxIter] [/MINVAL Value [Unit]]

    Compute visibilities on the current UV sampling  using  a  source  model
    made of the MaxIter first Clean Components, or of all pixel values above
    the given Value if /MINFLUX is present.

\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{MODEL /MINVAL}
\index{MODEL!/MINVAL}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]MODEL [MaxIter] /MINVAL Value [Unit]

    Construct the source model using all Clean Components until MaxIter (all
    if  MaxIter  is  0  or not specified). These components are stacked on a
    grid, and then all pixels above the given Value are taken as source mod-
    el to derive visibilities.

    Unit can be Jy, mJy, K or sigma. The default value is Jy.

\end{verbatim}
\subsection{SOLVE}
\index{SOLVE}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]SOLVE Time SNR [Reference]
          /MODE [Phase|Amplitude] [Antenna|Baseline] [Flag|Keep]

    Solve  the baseline or antenna based gains using the current UV data and
    current MODEL.

    Time is the integration time for the solution.  SNR is the minimum  Sig-
    nal to Noise Ratio required to find a solution.

\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{SOLVE /MODE}
\index{SOLVE!/MODE}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]SOLVE Time SNR [Reference]
          /MODE [Phase|Amplitude] [Antenna|Baseline] [Flag|Keep]

    Dependin on the /MODE arguments, the gains can be antenna-based or base-
    line-based, and include Phase or Amplitude, and data  without  solutions
    either KEEPed or FLAGged,

\subsection{UV\_SELF}
\index{UV\_SELF}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]UV_SELF [CenterX CenterY UNIT [Angle]]
      [/RANGE [Min Max Type]] [/RESTORE]

    Use  (and  if  specified  and/or needed create) the "Self Calibrated" UV
    dataset to make a dirty image, instead of using the current UV table.

    UV_SELF utilizes UV_MAP for imaging. See HELP UV_MAP for parameters.

\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{UV\_SELF /RANGE}
\index{UV\_SELF!/RANGE}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]UV_SELF [CenterX CenterY UNIT [Angle]] /RANGE  [Min  Max
    Type]

    Create and image the "Self Calibrated" UV data.

    The "Self Calibrated" UV dataset is created from the current UV data set
    by extracting the range of channels specified by  the  /RANGE  arguments
    Min   Max  Type.  Type can be CHANNEL, VELOCITY or FREQUENCY.  If /RANGE
    has no argument, all channels are averaged together.

    It is then updated by command SOLVE at each self-calibration loop.   See
    SOLVE and CLEAN\SELFCAL for details.

\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{UV\_SELF /RESTORE}
\index{UV\_SELF!/RESTORE}
\begin{verbatim}
        [CALIBRATE\]UV_SELF /RESTORE

    As UV_RESTORE but for the self-calibrated UV table.

    Restores  the Clean image from the Clean Component Table by removing the
    components from the Self-calibrated UV data and  imaging  the  residuals
    before adding them to the convolved Clean components.

    See UV_RESTORE for details.
