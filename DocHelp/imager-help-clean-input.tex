The  user  can  control  the algorithm through SIC variables. New
values can be given using "LET VARIABLE value". For ease of  use,
and  whenever  it is possible, a sensible value of each parameter
will automatically be computed from the context if the  value  of
the corresponding variable is set to its default value, i.e. zero
value and empty string. A few variables are initialized to  "rea-
sonable" values.
    [CLEAN_]CLEAN ?
Will  list  all main CLEAN__* variables controlling the CLEAN pa-
rameters for the current METHOD.
HELP CLEAN Variables will give a more complete list.
